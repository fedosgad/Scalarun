Specifications and general TODO

Idea:
	Hardware:
	generate sinusoid using (for now) SI4432 (maybe SI4463 later) plus ATMega168
	as USB-UART-SPI adapter, feed it to the DUT (device under test) and read results
	using RTL-SDR dongle

	Software:
	Linux kernel driver for generator, osmocom library for RTL-SDR, software with GUI
	on GTK/FLTK/wxWidgets (to be decided) 
	Run without load to read the device's own frequency response, maybe not once and
	with averaging. Than connect DUT and read again, compensate (subtract the device's
	frequency response?)
