File for TODO's, general thoughts and notes on development.

TODO:
	1. Add level shifter between Atmega and SI module

Thoughts:


Notes:
	Atmega328PA doesn't run 16MHz on 3.3V (according to datasheet) (see TODO 1.)

	The EZRadioPRO devices can be set to provide an unmodulated carrier
	signal for test purposes by setting the “modtyp[1:0]” bits to 0
	(bit[1:0] in the Modulation mode Control2 register).
